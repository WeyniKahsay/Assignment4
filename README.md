Web design plays a role on any device you have, like a phone, labtop or apple watch. It can take you anywhere that you are interested in. 
The Document Object Model (DOM) stands for a tree-like presentationof an HTML or XML document. 
HTML builds web content. XML moves data. XHTML is a flexible form of HTML. 
Every HTML page needs a <!doctype html> and <html> and <head> and <title> and <body>
The reason of the index.html page is to give a homepage of the website. and it shoud be used in the root directory.
The best uses of clean and organized code are using clear, descriptive, and consistent names for variables, functions, and classes that reflect their purposes.
